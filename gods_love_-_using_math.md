[http://www.creativebiblestudy.com/christianobjectlesson-math1.html]

----

**Use this Christian object lesson using math to illustrate just how much God loves us. It will definitely catch kid's attention!**


**Theme:** God's love goes over and beyond 100 percent!

**Object:** The following math demonstration.

**Scripture:**
 
```
Romans 5:8
But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 
```
```
Jeremiah 31:3:
The Lord appeared to us in the past, saying:
â€œI have loved you with an everlasting love;
    I have drawn you with unfailing kindness.
```
```
Romans 8:38-39
For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
```
####Christian object lesson: 
How many of you like Math? Today we're going to have a math lesson to find out how much God loves us.

From a strictly mathematical viewpoint:

What Equals 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%?

Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%?

We have all been in situations where someone wants you to GIVE OVER 100%.

How about ACHIEVING 101%?

What equals 100% in life?

Here's a little mathematical formula for our math object lesson that might help answer these questions:

```
If:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Is represented as:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26.
```
```
If:

H-A-R-D-W-O-R- K
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%
```
```
And:

K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E
11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%
```
```
But:

A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%
```
```
THEN, look how far the love of God will take you:

L-O-V-E-O-F-G-O-D
12+15+22+5+15+6+7+15+4 = 101%
```
Therefore, one can conclude with mathematical certainty that:

While Hard Work and Knowledge will get you close, and

Attitude will get you there,

It's the Love of God that will put you over the top!

Read `Romans 5:8` and discuss how God loves us just the way we are. He sent Jesus to die even while we were still sinners.

Read `Jeremiah 31:3` and talk about what the word "everlasting" means. God loves us with an everlasting love; it will never end.

Read `Romans 8:38-39` and explain that nothing can separate us from the love of God. Disease can take away our health, sadness can take away our happiness, a thief can steal our money, but NO one can take Jesus away from us!

End in a prayer thanking God for His great love.
